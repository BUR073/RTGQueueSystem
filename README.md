# RTGQueueSystem

Basic implementation fo RTG Queue system for Scudamore's. 

**Problem**

The problem that this program solves is to do with the RTG queue. Currently, the system used is paper based. When you clock in you are added to the bottom of the queue which is often written on scrap paper or tout tickets. The issue this very often leads to is people having different version of the queue written down on their sheets of paper. This leads to great confusion when working out who is meant to be touting, on time out or going on tour. The other issue that arrises is the queue changing. If someone misses their tour they can become misplaced in the queue which causes further confusion. 

**How I have implemented the program to solved the problem**

The program starts of with 3 lists that contains the codes for the RTGs that are on tour, touting and in time out. The program allows for the user to add more RTGs who will be properly placed in the correct queue wether touting or on time out depending on the number of RTGs touting at that time. You are then able to send RTGs on tour. Once this has been done the lists are changed to reflect the changes (E.G. RTG comes out of time out due to their being less people touting). RTGs returning from tour are added to the end of the correct list also. You are also able to remove an RTG that has clocked out.
